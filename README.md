##This project explores Netflix's content using raw SQL. It includes table creation and 15 real-world business queries to extract insights from the platform’s dataset. The analysis is done entirely in SQL using PostgreSQL, with a focus on learning, exploration, and content strategy insights.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- SQL (GROUP BY, Window Functions, CTEs, Text Search)
- Netflix Sample Dataset
